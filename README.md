# Robinhood API Unofficial Documentation

Few days ago saw a post(https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15994312) on how every developer should automate and robinhood really made me excited. As there was no official API documentation and not easy way to kick start your algorithm trading I decided to convert Sanko's documentation (https://github.com/sanko/Robinhood) into open api specification which is already a wonderful work.

This repository presents the unofficial api document in swagger specification (open api) https://swagger.io/
which lets us to generate the api client on your preffered language to consume the api. 

You can directly use the robinhood.json or robinhood.yaml file to generate a api client using 
https://editor.swagger.io/


Spring boot and Spring Fox is used to generate the swagger specification.
